Hi! I am Ada Fang. I am a PhD student at Harvard University in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, advised by Prof. <a href='https://zitniklab.hms.harvard.edu/'>Marinka Zitnik</a>. I am also a graduate student fellow at the <a href='https://www.harvard.edu/kempner-institute/leadership/#students'>Kempner Institute for the Study of Natural and Artificial Intelligence at Harvard University</a>.

My research lies at the intersection of chemistry and ML/AI. The universe of drug-like molecules, estimated at 10^60 molecules, is largely unexplored and I am working on developing dmachine learning algorithms to understand complex chemical biology relationships. My approach leverages large experimental datasets for modeling molecules through geometric deep learning and equivariant neural networks. I am currently pursuing the development of models that are chemically grounded by integrating scientific inductive biases.

I am also focused on using AI to empower scientists, particularly in generating novel hypotheses and conducting in silico experiments. There are many challenges and opportunities in AI for science, including ensuring access to unified datasets, benchmarks, experimental validation, and close collaboration with scientists. Overall, I am excited to integrate AI as a powerful tool for researchers to use for scientific discovery.
